How to play the Pokémon Battle

This game is for one player. The controls are rather simple. The number indicated to the side of the move, item, or option initiates it. To the right is a short description of the control. Below that is the PP (Pokémon Power) or amount of the item.

Example:
5 POTION       - +20 HP
               3

ITEMS
6 different types of items can be used while playing. Each one does something different.
***USE THEM WISELY***

MOVES
4 moves are available for damaging your opponent. Some are more powerful than others. Also, some moves are not very effective, while others are super effective. Pay attention to the type!

STORE
Use the store to purchase items. The way to obtain money is to win battles. The use and price are to the right of the item.

SAVING
When you win or lose a battle, your game data is saved. You keep the money you earned, your HP maximum, your enemy's HP maximum, your win/lose count, and your level. However, items are not saved, so any that are left over will be erased. There is a good part: when you start a new battle, the default items will regenerate, so you get free items every battle. Don't erase ANY of these: PKMNBATT.EXE, PKMNBATT.BAS, RULES1.LIS, RULES2.LIS, or RULES.TXT
