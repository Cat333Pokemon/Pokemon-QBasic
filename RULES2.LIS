- 6 different types of items can be used while playing. Each one

-

- 4 moves are available for damaging your opponent. Some are more       
- powerful than others. Also, some moves are not very effective,

-                                                                       
- STORE                                                                 
- Use the store to purchase items. The way to obtain money is to        
- win battles. The use and price are to the right of the item.          
-                                                                       
- SAVING                                                                
- When you win or lose a battle, your game data is saved. You keep      
- the money you earned, your HP maximum, your enemy's HP maximum,       
- your win/lose count, and your level. However, items are not           
- saved, so any that are left over will be erased. There is a good      
- part: when you start a new battle, the default items will             
- regenerate, but you get more or less for playing. Use the delete                      
- function to delete the .DAT files with MS DOS. You can also
- delete these files from your browser.
-
