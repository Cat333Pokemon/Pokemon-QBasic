TO USE

Insert disk into drive. If you do not know how to play read RULESD.TXT* or RULESW.DOC* to learn. There are five games on this disk. It is recommended that you play PKMNV3.EXE; it has the best user-friendly options. If you have QuickBasic 1.0 (not on this disk) or higher you may use the .BAS files. The .DAT files are your save games**.

*The "W" means Windows version (fonts) and "D" means DOS (no fonts).

**It IS possible to cheat. Open up a .DAT file and change the value to a new value. LEAVE A SPACE BEFORE THE NUMBER YOU TYPE. Save. You can also open the cheat mode on the game. Edit ALL values.
